## Running the analysis

### Step 1: Connecting to nycdb PostGreSQL database

In order to run the SQL queries referenced in this analysis, you will need to set up a copy of the [nycdb PostGreSQL database](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb) on your local computer. You can visit the [nycdb README](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb/blob/main/src/README.md) for documentation on how to create your own copy of the database locally.
